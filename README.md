## What is Electron vLog?
A light-weight, zero-dependency package that *(spoiler alert)* visually logs your work!
* **Take videos** of your Electron app - want to put together a quick demo? Or make it easier for users to share videos of your app?
* **Take perfect screenshots** of your app window natively without having to edit and snip and crop   
* **Make a time-lapse** to visually document your app's journey from start to finish. See how your UI evolved from a plain window to a glorious app!  
(*How does this work?* Automatically take screenshots of your app at regular intervals; you can stitch them all together in the end to get a great video of your app's journey!)

## Examples

## Installing the package:
```shell script
npm install --save electron-vlog
```
or if you want to use this package only during development:
```shell script
npm install --save-dev electron-vlog
```
## Code setup:

`require` the `electron-vlog` module in *any* Javascript file that has been included in the HTML page you want to record.

For example, if `index.js` is included in the `index.html` that you want to capture/record, like this:
```html
...
<script src="./index.js"></script>
...
```
then add this one line to your `index.js` file:
````javascript
require('electron-vlog');
````  

*That's all the code you need!*  

## Usage:
You can now use **keyboard shortcuts** to perform actions.  
*(Note: You can customize behavior, as detailed in the options section.)*
### `Crtl+Shift+M` Captures a screenshot 
Captures an image of the window in focus while pressing the shortcut.

### `Crtl+Shift+B` - Toggles Timelapse 
First press starts timelapse, second press stops timelapse.  
Takes a screenshot every few seconds - only if there's a change in appearance.  
That is, the screenshot is saved only if it differs from the previous screenshot, so that you don't end up with the same images! 

### `Crtl+Shift+N` - Toggles Screen Recording  
First press starts recording, second press stops recording.

## Programmatic usage(API):
Basic API's have been exposed to perform these actions with code. 

### Options
_To be added_

### What is Electron vLog?
A light-weight, zero-dependency package that *(spoiler alert)* visually logs your work!
* **Take videos** of your Electron app - want to put together a quick demo? Or make it easier for users to share videos of your app?
* **Take perfect screenshots** of your app window natively without having to edit and snip and crop   
* **Make a time-lapse** to visually document your app's journey from start to finish. See how your UI evolved from a plain window to a glorious app!  
(*How does this work?* Automatically take screenshots of your app at regular intervals; you can stitch them all together in the end to get a video, which makes for a great journey story to look back on your hard work!)
